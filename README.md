# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personalized dotfiles and setup scripts for macOS and Linux environments.

## Structure

- **`<package>/`** - Each directory is a `stow` package (e.g., `zsh`, `nvim`, `tmux`).
- **`Brewfile`** - A list of all Homebrew packages, casks, and VS Code extensions for macOS.
- **`install.sh`** - A setup script to automate the installation process.

## Quick Setup

On a new machine, you can run the following commands to get started:

```bash
# Install Command Line Tools (required for git on macOS)
xcode-select --install

# Clone the dotfiles repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles

# Run the full installation
./install.sh
```

This will automatically:

- ✅ Install Homebrew (on macOS).
- ✅ Install all packages from the `Brewfile` (on macOS).
- ✅ Create symlinks for all your configuration files using `stow`.

## Usage

The `install.sh` script can be used in two ways:

- **`./install.sh`**: This will run the full installation, including installing packages and creating symlinks.
- **`./install.sh --stow-only`**: This will skip the package installation and only create the symlinks.
